 NEWS for R Package "SPEI"
---------------------------

__To do:

1. Complete documentation for pwmLC.Rd.
2. Review method plot.spei() that produces wrong results in some cases.


__Version history:

_Version 1.4, May 2013.
1. Minor fixes to functions \code{\link{penman}} and \code{\link{pwm}}.
2. Documentation of the penman function defined by mistake ed as the saturation vapour pressure, while it should read 'actual vapour pressure'.
3. Function zzz.R added to display basic information about the SPEI package at startup.
4. Function \code{\link{SPEINews}} added to display the NEWS file.

_Version 1.3, March 2013.
1. Minor fixes to functions \code{\link{spei}} and \code{\link{penman}}.
2. Added new option for user-supplied SPEI parameters in the \code{\link{spei}} function. This overrides the fitting of a probability function to the data.
3. Added new dataset \code{\link{cabinda}} from Allen et al. (1998).

_Version 1.2, October 2012.
1. Fixed a bug causing several functions to fail when a time series not belonging to matrix class was provided.
2. Function \code{\link{plot.spei}} now distinguises between calls to spei and spi and labels the axis accordingly.

_Version 1.1, March 2012.
1. Functions \code{\link{spei}} and \code{\link{spi}} now yield an object of class "spei".
2. New functions for summarizing and plotting "spei" objects are provided.
3. An option to establish a reference period for the computation of the indices has been implemented in functions \code{\link{spei}} and \code{\link{spi}}.

_Version 1.0, January 2012.
First release of the SPEI package.
